# v0.3.0 (May 2020)

This is a major release introducing scipy's integration and optimization routines into the framework.

## New forward modelling

* Replaced the self written *time_integration* routine with *scipy.integrate.solve_ivp*.
* Adjusted *forward_model* and plotting routines accordingly and introduced supporting functions.

## New inverse modelling

* Replaced the self written *gradient_descent* method with *scipy.optimize.minimize*.
* Adjusted *inverse_model* and plotting routines accordingly and introduced supporting functions.

## Visualization

* Added *initial_guess* plotting function to visualize the model output before any optimization has been applied.
